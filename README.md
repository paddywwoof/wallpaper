*farris01.pyde* is a (python addon) processing sketch for making the 
wallpaper with CPU.

*Farris_67.py* is a pi3d based demo using images from *textures/* and shaders
from *shaders/*

To run pi3d you need to install the module which depends on having OpenGL 2.0
(or OpenGL ES2.0) GPU, numpy and PIL. The demo.py file is used to direct
the pi3d import to the local modified repository - comment out if you
are using the normal released version.

See pi3d.github.io

I will add more comments to the shader and the python file to explain what's
going on.
